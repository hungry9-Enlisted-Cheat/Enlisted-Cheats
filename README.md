## Features

Unlike generic trainers, this Enlisted cheat software is built specifically for squad combat scenarios:

* **Auto Aim Module** – Smooth precision-lock to enemy targets with adjustable FOV values (e.g., 25–60).
* **ESP Overlay** – Real-time wall vision showing soldiers, tanks, and artillery positions.
* **Loot Highlights** – Drop tracker system that marks ammo crates, medkits, and rare weapons.
* **Vehicle Assistance** – Aim prediction for mounted MGs and tank turrets.
* **Customizable Hotkeys** – Example: `F3` to toggle ESP, `Shift + RMB` for rapid aim snap.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Use configs tailored to each campaign (Normandy, Moscow, Tunisia) for the best performance.
